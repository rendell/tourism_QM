```{r}
airport_distance("AUA","MCO")
```
# Import data
Here i have manually combined two airport combinations, but its easier to fill in say a spreadsheet and import it into R.
```{r}
first <- c("AUA","MCO")
second<-c("MCO","YHZ")
cbind(first, second)
```
# Loop
The loop at the moment consders two combinations. 
```{r}
output <- for (i in 1:2){
  print(paste(airport_distance(first[i],second[i])))
}
```
